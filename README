1) Create an empty DB
$ sqlite3 db.sqlite3
sqlite> create table zogger(serverName varchar(64), roomName varchar(64), ircUser varchar(64), currentTime varchar(64), ircMessage varchar(2048));
sqlite> select * from zogger;

2) Default zogger(irc-logger) settings
serverName = "irc.freenode.net:6667"
roomName = "#my-bot-test"
userName = "my-bot-test"
helloMsg = "ZOG is logging you"
dbPath = "db.sqlite3"
dbName = "zogger"
roomAssword = "" // Using passwordless login
assFile = "" // Password file is not used by default. It should contain password to avoid a commandline parameter being visible in "ps"
To override them, use cmdline switches:
./zogger -serverName="irc.freenode.net:6667"
It is possible to run multiple zogger instances with multiple chat rooms on multiple servers.

3) Look for some data:
$ sqlite3 db.sqlite3
sqlite> select * from zogger;

4) Default webzogger settings:
listenSocket = ":9991"
dbPath = "db.sqlite3"
dbName = "zogger"
webUser = "" // No HTTP-authentication by default
webAss = "" // No HTTP-authentication by default
webAssFile = "" // Password file is not used by default. It should contain password to avoid a commandline parameter being visible in "ps"
webCrtFile = "" // No HTTPS by default, pass your ssl certificate file here
webKeyFile = "" // No HTTPS by default, pass your ssl key file here
You can override them with cmdline switches, or just:
./webzogger
and proxy the 9991 port via your web-server frontend.

The built binary can be stripped and compressed with upx.
You can use the same password file both for webzogger and multiple zoggers, writing logs to the same database.
